Cleanmgr.exe is a system utility in Windows operating systems, specifically part of the Disk Cleanup tool, designed to help users free up disk space by removing unnecessary files, such as temporary files, system files, and files in the Recycle Bin. As a legitimate Microsoft application with a version of 10.0.15063.0, it is considered safe and is not a virus or malware. However, like many executable files, it can be mimicked by malicious software, so users should ensure that they are running the genuine version located in the C:\Windows\System32 directory. While cleanmgr.exe generally operates without issues, some users may encounter errors related to insufficient permissions or system file corruption that can prevent it from launching or functioning correctly. Regular use of this tool can help maintain optimal performance and storage management on Windows devices.
